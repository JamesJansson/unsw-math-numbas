# Project overview

The project consisted of 4 major deliverable items
* Chart element identifier
* Reimann sum grapher
* Unit circle trignometry
* Differentiation estimation and limits
* Integral graphing



# Chart element identifier
In this section, students are required to understand core concepts including:

* Steady points
* Inflection points
* X-intercepts
* Y-intercepts

The project allows the following function types to be graphed:
* Quartics
* Cubics
* Quadractics

In order to make the questions answerable by students, special functions are constructed that give simple solutions for turning points. 

The question is structured such that the chart can be given either as a primer for the student to determine the turning point, or as a description in the answer section.


# Reimann sum grapher

In this section, students are required to understand about estimating integrals. To do this, we use a Riemann Sum, which divides a chart into a finite number of sections. 

The Riemann sum grapher allows the question to demonstrate estimating the area of rectangle using the graph esimtate at the left, right or center of the chart. It also allows the use of a rhombus to estimate the area.

# Unit circle trignometry
In this section, a chart was produced that demonstrates the relationship between the unit circle and the corresponding trigonometric graph.

By dragging the point around the circle, the student can see how the unit circle interacts with the trignometric function.
