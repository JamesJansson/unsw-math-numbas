# Project overview
The core challenge of the project is to create visually appealing and correct representations of the underlying mathematical concepts of the course. The questions also need to be able to be used in exams or used multiple times by the same student. To do this, random values for the coefficients of the functions being used. Special care has to be taken in the construction of the function and of the graphical representation of the function, such that important points are clear. 

The project consisted of the following deliverable items:
* Chart element identifier
* Reimann sum grapher
* Unit circle trigonometry
* Differentiation estimation and limits
* Integral graphing

# Chart element identifier
In this section, students are required to understand core concepts including:
* Steady points (local minima and maxima)
* Inflection points
* X-intercepts
* Y-intercepts

The project allows the following function types to be graphed:
* Quartics
* Cubics
* Quadratics

In order to make the questions answerable by students, special functions are constructed that give simple solutions for stable (turning) points. 

The question is structured such that the chart can be given either as a primer for the student to determine the turning point, or as a description in the answer section.

# Riemann Sum grapher
The Riemann Sum grapher allows students to understand estimating integrals. To do this, we use a Riemann Sum, which divides a chart into a finite number of sections. 

The Riemann sum grapher allows the question to demonstrate estimating the area of rectangle using the graph estimate at the left, right or center of the chart. It also allows the use of a rhombus to estimate the area. 

# Unit circle trigonometry
In this section, a chart was produced that demonstrates the relationship between the unit circle and the corresponding trigonometric graph.

By dragging the point around the circle, the student can see how the unit circle interacts with the trigonometric function. 

# Differentiation estimation and limits
The purpose of this section is to understand the construction of the derivative as a 'rise over run'. As the 'run' (the length along the x-axis) approaches zero, the hypotenuse of the triangle increasingly approximates the tangent to the curve and hence becomes a more accurate tool for calculating the derivative.

The question is multi-step, and requires the student to calculate the gradient as the 'run' or delta x approaches zero.
