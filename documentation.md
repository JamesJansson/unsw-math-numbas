# Project overview

The project consisted of 4 majors deliverable items
* A chart element identifier
* 

# Chart element identifier
In this section, students are required to understand core concepts including:

* Steady points
* Inflection points
* X-intercepts
* Y-intercepts

The project allows the following function types to be graphed:
* Quartics
* Cubics
* Quadractics

The question is structured such that the chart can be given either as a primer for the student to determine the turning point, or as a description in the answer section.

In the project, we were given the
