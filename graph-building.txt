x -> 0+
x -> 0-
x -> inf
x -> -inf
Add points on the line that are at turning points
Determine x_s1, x_s2, as well as the local maximum and minimum
Determine  x_inflection
What is the gradient

// With all chart information on
Identify x_s1 and x_s2 on the chart
Identify x_inflection

Identify x and y intercept
Asymptotes 
1/x + x 
tan(x)
x + e^-x
sin(x)/x 

First step: find y' as x-> infinity
Then, create a line with the function y=mx+b
set y=f(x), e.g. x + e^-x = mx + b
